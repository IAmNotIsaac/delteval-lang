by default, an array's length gets pre-determined by the count of elements it
was initialized with. however, a specific limit can be set simply by appending
[l] directly after the array, where l is the chosen length of the array.
example can be seen below.
<#

let b = [7, 8, 9] : [5];	# the array was initialized with 3 elements, however, it has room for 5.
print b;
