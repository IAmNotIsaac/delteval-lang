# delteval-lang
programming language made in python simply for the purpose of learning programming language development


due to its current stage in development, it pretty much serves as a basic calculator.
all expressions will be evaluated and printed out in order.

scopes, though existing, have <s>no</s> **LOTS OF** purpose, as i <s>havent</s> **HAVE** gotten around to adding variables <s>or</s> **BUT NOT** functions yet.
hopefully the coming days will see a change to that.

FEEL FREE TO USE WHATEVER CODE HOWEVER YOU PLEASE!!!!
