# delteval-lang
programming language made in python simply for the purpose of learning programming language development


due to its current stage in development, it pretty much serves as a basic calculator.
all expressions will be evaluated and printed out in order.

scopes, though existing, have no purpose, as i havent gotten around to adding variables or functions yet.
hopefully the coming days will see a change to that.


FEEL FREE TO USE WHATEVER CODE HOWEVER YOU PLEASE!!!!
